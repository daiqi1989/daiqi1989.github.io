I'm currently a senior researcher in Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing. I received my Ph.D. from Fudan University in 2017, under the supervision of [Prof. Yu-Gang Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f3_FP8AAAAAJ). I joined MSRA since graduation.

My research interests lie on computer vision and multimedia. Particularly, I worked on video understanding and analytics (including action recognition, detection, representation learning, etc.), and video generation.
